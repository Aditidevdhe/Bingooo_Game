# Bingooo_Game
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Bingo game using C++. The game involves two players: Player 1 and Player 2. Player 1's numbers are drawn automatically by the program, while Player 2 manually inputs the numbers.

Features --
--Random Bingo Card Generation: Each player receives a randomly generated Bingo card with numbers from 1 to 25.
--Automatic Number Drawing for Player 1: The program automatically draws numbers for Player 1 at regular intervals.
--Manual Number Input for Player 2: Player 2 inputs the drawn numbers manually.
--Bingo Check: The program checks if either player has achieved Bingo (a full row, column, or diagonal of marked numbers) after each draw.
--Visual Representation: The Bingo cards for both players are displayed after each turn, showing the marked numbers.
